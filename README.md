# CS160 Winter 2012 Testcases for the SIMPLE language.

* Files starting with valid.\* should parse with *no* errors.

* Files starting with invalid.\* should *not* parse and should throw an error.

* You should be able to run a testcase with `./simple < testcases/<a file from
  the repository>` with one of the two configurations below.

## Usage

> NOTICE: Git is preinstalled on CSIL machines.

### As a git Submodule (if you're doing the project with Git) 

You can add this repository as a submodule to the git
repository for your project by doing this:

1. `cd your_cs160_project`

2. `git submodule add "https://github.com/senbrow/CS160-Testcases.git" testcases`

When you need to update the test cases, cd to the `testcases` folder and do `git
pull`.

### As a seperate folder (if your project is not under version control)

You really should be using version control for your projects. The great thing
about git is that you can start version control with a plain `git init`.
Anyway, maybe next quarter. For now though: 

1. `cd your_cs160_project`

2. `git clone "https://github.com/senbrow/CS160-Testcases.git" testcases`

When you need to update the test cases, cd to the `testcases` folder and do `git
pull`.

## How to contribute

Fork senbrow's CS160-Testcases git repository in Github. `cd` to the
`testcases` folder, and do:
    
1. `git remote add <insert your user name here> git://github.com/<insert your user name here>/test.git`

2. `git add <the file you want to add>`

3. `git push <your user name here> master`

Then go on Github and do a pull request (the button is on your fork of the
repository asking Sean to pull from your repository's master branch). Github
should show a yellow box where you can do a pull request.

**If you can't figure this out just email us the test case or make an issue with
the code in it.**
